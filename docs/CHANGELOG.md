# Changelog

This file records material amendments to feature specs discovered
during planning or implementation, per Constitution Principle VIII.
Entries are append-only.

## 2026-05-17 — spec(001-auth-and-roles) amendment

- Replaced "Team" entity with direct-manager hierarchy
  (`profiles.manager_id` self-FK).
- Onboarding reduced to `full_name` only.
- Skip-level per-employee visibility explicitly forbidden going forward.

Rationale: the privacy model in `PROJECT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` requires
direct-manager + skip-level-aggregates-only. Teams as a separate layer
add access-control surface without serving any current privacy
invariant. Teams may return later as a pure grouping concept if
reporting features need them.

## 2026-05-17 — spec(001-auth-and-roles) amendment

- Added FR-020: OTP entry fallback for signup confirmation and
  password reset.
- Added FR-021: Theme toggle on all unauthenticated auth surfaces.

Rationale: Smoke testing revealed (a) Supabase emails ship with both
a magic link and a 6-digit OTP, and the latter currently has no
consumption path in the app — users whose link breaks or arrives
sluggishly are stuck; (b) the existing theme toggle on authed surfaces
makes its absence on the auth surfaces (/login, /signup,
/forgot-password, /reset-password) feel like an oversight rather than
a deliberate design choice, especially since Constitution Principle VI
treats light/dark as equal-priority.

## 2026-05-17 — constitution(V) — display font: Instrument Serif → DM Serif Display
The design token `--font-display` was already swapped on the implementation side (DECISIONS.md entry "Lock display font to DM Serif Display"). The constitution is brought into alignment with the implementation.

## 2026-05-18 — Feature ordering reshuffle

Two reorderings, both because the original ordering put consumers before
their dependencies:

- **005 ↔ 006**: per-user-calibration now precedes stress-inference-service.
  The constitution requires predictions to be deltas from a per-user
  baseline; inference has nothing to subtract from until calibration ships
  first.
- **010/011/012**: privacy-controls-and-transparency moves to 010, ahead of
  the two manager dashboards (now 011 team-lead, 012 admin). The privacy
  slider and visibility-scope rules determine what data the dashboards
  are allowed to query; building them against placeholder defaults would
  force rework when privacy lands.

No code or specs affected — only 001 has shipped; the rest were names in
a list.

## 2026-05-19 — spec(003-employee-dashboard-shell) — Out-of-Scope bullet superseded by hotfix `8dc822b`

`specs/003-employee-dashboard-shell/spec.md` (committed as `f4a1218`,
review-edited through `5de64d2`) contains an Out-of-Scope bullet
naming the `/login?error=expired_link` notice bug as a separate
hotfix branch off `main`, with a recon step before the branch opens.

That hotfix shipped between spec commit and `/speckit.plan`:

- `0acb0e1` — `fix(001): render expired-link notice on /login`
- `8dc822b` — merge of PR #2 onto `main`
- The `003-employee-dashboard-shell` branch's merge-base with
  `main` is `8dc822b`, confirming the branch is rebased onto
  post-hotfix `main`.

The bullet is therefore stale: the bug it points at is fixed, and
the recon step is unnecessary. **The committed spec is NOT
modified.** This entry records the supersession per Principle VIII
(spec amendments live in CHANGELOG, not in retroactive edits to
the spec).

`docs/BACKLOG.md` will be updated during feature 003's
`/speckit.implement` step 13 (smoke tests) to reclassify the
expired-link entry as `merged`.

## 2026-05-20 — plan(003-employee-dashboard-shell) — manual shadcn install substituted for `shadcn init`

Feature 003: shadcn CLI 4.7.0's `--preset=base-nova` default
introduces Inter→Geist font swap, red `--destructive`, and a generic
oklch palette that conflict with Constitution Principle V, FR-042,
and Decision B respectively. Manual init (hand-authored
`components.json` + `lib/utils.ts` + direct dep installs) substituted
for `shadcn init`. `shadcn add` retained for primitive scaffolding
only. Decisions A, B, E unchanged; their target outputs match the
manual-init result.

This is a plan AMENDMENT recorded via CHANGELOG, not a re-decision.
Any future re-init must use the manual path until shadcn's defaults
realign with the Decision A/B/E target shape.
